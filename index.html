    <h2>About Anna Sheer</h2>
    <img src="images/Anna Sheer.jpg" alt="Anna Sheer">
    <p>Anna is a certified Bodysex®️ coach through the Betty Dodson Association in New York and offers emancipating sex education through pleasure-focused coaching, workshops, and retreats for women and female bodied people. Her mission is to support women in removing shame and guilt around their sexual pleasure and replacing it with self-knowledge—particularly around the female body and the female model of arousal. She was fortunate to grow up in a sex-positive family, where sex was never a taboo subject. Instead, it was seen as a natural and normal part of life, something that could be openly discussed. It was only later, through her work as a sex educator, that she realised how rare and special that upbringing was.

She has worked with numerous women who have benefited from a life-changing perspective about their relationship with themselves, their bodies, sexuality and pleasure. Anna is an artist and an educator who believes self-knowledge is the key to empowerment, confidence, and independence. 

Anna has spent over two decades working as a facilitator and teacher across the cultural sector in operas, theatres, museums, schools, and academies. Since 2012, she is the CEO of Sowieso!—an inclusive association offering art and dance workshops for children with disabilities, always placing creativity at the heart of her practice. - This part doesn’t have to be in it. 

Creativity and sexuality are powerful outlets for personal expression. These are the spaces where humans truly show up as themselves, it's an expression of life force giving birth to babies, new ideas, projects, and visions.

“Changing the world one orgasm at a time”—a quote by Betty—has enriched Anna’s charismatic mission to support people in gaining the knowledge to lead confident, sexual relationships with themselves and others..</p>
