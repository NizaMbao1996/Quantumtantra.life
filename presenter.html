                    Anna is a certified Bodysex®️ coach through the Betty Dodson Association in New York and offers
                    emancipating sex education through pleasure-focused coaching, workshops, and retreats for women and
                    female bodied people. Her mission is to support women in removing shame and guilt around their
                    sexual pleasure and replacing it with self-knowledge—particularly around the female body and the
                    female model of arousal. She was fortunate to grow up in a sex-positive family, where sex was never
                    a taboo subject.
